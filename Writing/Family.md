## [_The Ideal Imperfect Family_](http://www.snpp.com/other/papers/ea.paper.html)

### Thesis

> Unlike common representations of the "typical" American family seen in television shows like Father Knows Best or Leave It To Beaver, The Simpsons presents a family unit that is all at once unique, attainable, and lovable, unlike those presented in either of the other two shows. From the show's creators' rebellion against "traditional" family sitcoms to each of the Simpson family member's caricatures, this show satirizes, but ultimately redeems, each unit of the nuclear family (father, mother, and children)

### Grounds

- context of normal
- Simpsons as unique
