* viewer rating = commercials
* "real" news

* drama
* **intertextuality**: "the fundamental and inescapable interdependence of all textual meaning upon the structures of meaning proposed by other texts"

* the candy industry train show
* like willy wonka, looking for a ticket
* "for the greater good"
* "two surviving musketeers"
* "candy-shaped rat poison convention"
* "see you in hell, candy boys!"
* alligator grabbing girls ass, sexual harassment
* "indignation coordinator"
* start a new life under the sea
* news dramatizes and cuts to make him look guilty
* bias, agenda is creating a story
* mob mentality
* "FOX" night at the movies, portrait of an ass-grabber
* this is just a television poll
* lisa articulates problem -> parody
* "tv's always right"
* speculations
* non-sequitur arguments
