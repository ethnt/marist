### Thesis

Today, all reporting by the mainstream media is in some way exaggerated to heighten interest and to increase the amount of viewers or readers. Television shows like the _The Simpsons_ use infotainment to parody itself on FOX by furthering this exaggeration to mock the media's reporting of world news.

### Arguments

- Exaggeration of event taking place (Homer grabbing candy => Homer sexually assaulting)
- Exaggeration of presentation ("two rules of television: don't swear, and don't whip it out")

- The media does not report on important news, but rather the news that will gain the most viewers.
- The news the media _does_ report on is often blown out of proportion to manipulate people.

### Paragraph

Media sources each tend to follow an agenda that typically coincides with they monetary sources. These media outlets do not report on actual, important news, but rather the news that will gain the most viewers. In _The Simpsons_ episode "Homer Badman", the media exaggerated Homer's actions and reported on completely baseless accusations. The witch hunt following his actions essentially created a trial by media.

On Sean Hannity's show on FOX News, Hannity reported on "average Americans feeling the pain of Obamacare". Each guest recounted their Obamacare horror stories: canceled policies, premium hikes, and other burdens. Salon reporter Eric Stern fact-checked this segment by re-interviewing the guests, and found that they had not even used Obamacare in the first place. http://www.salon.com/2013/10/18/inside_the_fox_news_lie_machine_i_fact_checked_sean_hannity_on_obamacare/
