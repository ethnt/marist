# Final Exam

In his commencement address to the Kenyon College class of 2005, the late novelist David Foster Wallace gave the most unusual address. Instead of commemorating the graduates on the presumably fantastic liberal arts education they received and where they are going in life, he brought into question the value  of their knowledge. "The capital-T Truth is about life before death. It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over: 'This is water, this is water.' (Wallace)"

In our Writing for College class at Marist College, we are receiving what is almost the definition of a liberal arts education. All students are required to take the course, despite the fact that most of their majors are not related to writing at all. So what then is the purpose of Writing for College?

Of course, there's the practical aspect — all students will need to write something at some point. Not all students come into university being college-level writers and could use some practice and instruction.

But then there's the deeper, more meaningful purpose. In high school, they used to say that they weren't teaching us facts and dates and formulas, but rather we were "learning how to learn". Now that we've entered college, I think that aim has changed only slightly: instead of learning how to learn, we're now learning how to think.

The goal of our education isn't _really_ to learn skills and facts and figures — anyone with enough time and patience can learn how to do something or memorize a list of facts. No, what we're learning is how to be aware of our surroundings.

This is what David Foster Wallace is getting at when he says "It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time…" We need the awareness of what knowledge is currently out there, the awareness of what other people are possibly undertaking, and the awareness of our potential as students.

In our Writing for College class, we approached questions and topics with the claims, grounds, and warrants approach. Each one of these steps requires an awareness of what knowledge is currently out there about what we're writing about and how we can incorporate that into our work. Rehashing what people have already said is useless — using other people's work to then expand upon your different point is a useful skill. This exigence is the basis of most research being done today, across all fields.

But this mindset should extend beyond the campus to our everyday lives. Wallace talked about his experience driving home from work in traffic and then going to the grocery store and being so very annoyed about the sheer mundaneness of it all. But, he decided to rethink this rage that he has — why should he be mad at the person who's taking so long at the register? Certainly they have their own problems and concerns?

It is this awareness that we need to grasp from this Writing for College class. Our viewpoint of what else is out there that we have to learn is what will make us excel in university and beyond.
