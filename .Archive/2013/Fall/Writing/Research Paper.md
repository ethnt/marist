Paragraphs:
- Christianity
- Atheism
- Other Religions

Since 1989, _The Simpsons_ have been a source of social and political criticism and satire. Their place on the FOX Network and their popularity has given them a shield for cancellation, thus giving them a podium to give their often shocking opinions.

One of the sectors that _The Simpsons_ often tackles is religion. Given how big of a part religion plays in many American's lives, it is an easy target for criticism. When most think of religion, they think of their own church, synagogue, or mosque. They feel secure in their beliefs, and they certainly believe that their faith is "correct". In general, _The Simpsons_ do not criticize these people. Instead, _The Simpsons_' satire of religion demonstrates the often radical ideals of those in society.

The easiest target for _The Simpsons_ is Christianity. Many of the characters go to the First Church of Springfield, a Protestant church that is presided over by the Reverend Timothy Lovejoy. The Simpson family attends this church, and the children attend Sunday school (often unwillingly). Bart's troublemaking nature makes this the perfect context to poke fun at Christian teachings. When he starts asking increasingly ridiculous questions about who will go to heaven and hell, the teacher breaks down, pleading "I don't know! All these questions! Is a little blind faith too much to ask? [1]" From a purely scientific point of view, all religions rely on blind faith for them to function as a belief system. The church doesn't particularly like prying questions — when you get down to the very heart of some issues, the response to some queries are "it just is". _The Simpsons_ effectively sum up this attitude by asking Bart to just _believe_ — not to have questions answered.

In fact, most of the characters are not literate with the Bible, especially Homer. He gets into an argument with Lovejoy, who tells him "Homer, I'd like you to remember 7:26. 'A foolish man who has built his house on sand.' Homer: "And you remember… Matthew… 21:17!" Lovejoy: "'And he left them and went out of the city into Bethany and lodged there?'" "Yeah… think about it!" Even Lovejoy is known to make up portions of the Bible to justify his agenda. To justify the old Springfield tradition of massacring snakes on Whacking Day, he "reads", "And the Lord said, 'Whack ye all the serpents that crawl on their bellies and thy town shall be a beacon to others.' [2]" This arises with the real life church as well — misinterpretations abound. In the 1600s, scientists such as Galileo Galilei were put under heavy pressure to cease scientific research that contradicted what the Bible was interpreted as saying. Galileo was the first to say that the Earth orbits the Sun, and not the other way around. This was against what the Catholic Church had interpreted in the Bible — unless he recanted his position, he would have been burned at the stake. It wasn't until 1992 that the Catholic Church formally admitted that their interpretation of the Bible was incorrect and offered an apology. The New York Times wrote "The address by the Pope before the Pontifical Academy of Sciences closed a 13-year investigation into the Church's condemnation of Galileo in 1633, one of history's most notorious conflicts between faith and science. [3]" Obviously, burning someone at the stake because they disagree with what you believe in is an overreaction.

This is one of many conflicts in which religion comes up against science. The two are the polar opposites of each other — one is about faith, and one is about hard facts. _The Simpsons_ play on this in the episode _Lisa the Skeptic_ when the judge presiding over a trial says "As for science vs. religion I'm issuing a restraining order. Science should stay 500 yards from religion at all times. [4]" This ruling is due to the religious zealots of Springfield rioting and destroying all scientific institutions when Lisa goes on television to say that a skeleton  with wings found in an archaeological dig is not an angel.

What _The Simpsons_ portrays as a radical opinion is often a real opinion that people have in real life. For example, the theory of evolution versus the Christian belief of creationism plays into episodes often. In the episode _The Monkey Suit_, the show satirizes the famous Scopes Monkey Trial. The lawsuit alleged that John Scopes, a Tennessee science teacher, violated the Butler Act, a law that prevented instructors from teaching evolution. At this point in time, 99.9% of scientists are in support of evolution[5]. Thus, within the scientific community, support of creationism is a radical idea. Despite this, proponents of creationism continue to challenge the teaching of evolution in school.

In _The Monkey Suit_, the teaching of evolution is banned in Springfield. Aghast, Lisa begins to teach classes about evolution, but is caught by Chief Wiggum. She is put on trial, and Lisa seems to be losing for the longest time because of ambiguous arguments about God's existence and the "missing link" in evolution. It takes Homer acting like a monkey to convince the jury that Lisa should be ruled innocent and the ban on evolution repealed.

Proponents of various religions call for reform in favor of their particular faith quite a bit in the United States. Muslims and Christians alike are against equality for homosexuals. Up until the election of Pope Francis, the Catholic Church's official stance on gay marriage and gay rights had been that of absolute denial. People who took this word as fact have done terrible things to the gay community, such as kill homosexuals or crucify them because of their sexual orientation [6].

God himself also makes an appearance in many episodes. Ironically enough, he is often the dissenting opinion to many religious points brought up in the episode. He first appeared in a dream that Homer had when he skipped church in the episode "Homer the Heretic". God is angry at Homer for "forsaking his church", to which Homer points out that he's not a bad guy, as he works hard loves his children — he just doesn't understand why he needs to spend half his Sunday about how he's going to hell. He talks about what parts of the sermon he doesn't like, and God ultimately agrees with him. In the episode "Thank God It's Doomsday", Homer convinces him to undo the Rapture and return everyone to Earth.

_The Simpsons_ takes these radical opinions and satirizes and hyperbolizes them to the point of ridiculousness to make an opinion about the current state of affairs in society. By having people such as Reverend Lovejoy be on the far end of the spectrum, they are trying to show just how ridiculous a lot of the opinions people have about religion.
