1. Define the following: _ethos_, _logos_, _pathos_:

* _ethos_: _Ethos_ is an appeal to ethics to build credibility to the speaker or narrator.
* _logos_: _Logos_ is an appeal to logic with facts.
* _pathos_: _Pathos_ is an appeal to emotion.

2. Identify those appeals in the following paragraphs. Describe briefly the effect that the writer creates by using them.

i. In "Looking Out for No. 2", Ian Ayres uses all three forms of rhetoric. He uses _logos_ when comparing home toilets to office toilets ("We don't have single-sex toilets at home, we don't need them in the office") and while explaining why Delta Airlines doesn't label restrooms on planes as a result of efficiency ("I see my male colleagues waiting in line to use the men's room, while the women's toilet is unoccupied"). He uses _ethos_ to build credibility by making the case that the University of Chicago has 10 gender-neutral restrooms on campus. And, he uses _pathos_ by comparing these single-gender toilets to discrimination. Given that most people are against discrimination, he is creating a double standard that the audience must come to terms with. 

ii. In Winston Churchill's speech to the House of Commons, he mostly uses _pathos_ to convince Parliament to declare war on Germany. By saying that "we shall go on to the end" and that "we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be", he is creating a do-or-die situation that appeals to the House's nationalism. It would be hard for an MP to stand by the argument that they _won't_ fight until the end.

3. Write an argument using those 3 appeals. This can be the same argument written 3 different ways or 3 different arguments. Each example should be at least a few sentences and should look something like the examples above.

i. _ethos_: Marist College should put air conditioning units in the freshman dormitories. All comparable colleges have air conditioning within freshman housing, so it is possible to lose bright students because of the housing situation.

ii. _pathos_: Marist College should put air conditioning units in the freshman dormitories. Their grades often slip during the hot, unbearable months of September and May, and putting air conditioning in the dorms would solve this issue. Additionally, there are students with health issues that require that they keep a normal body temperature — without this, they can overheat and get heat exhaustion or heat stroke.

iii. _logos_: Marist College should put air conditioning units in the freshman dormitories. The school has a large amount of revenue from the exorbitant tuition and room and board prices, and they have a profit each year. Air conditioning units are not terribly expensive, and a contractor could finish the job in the summer months without too much of a hassle to the school administration. It would not be too much of a hardship to simply add the units to the room of each building.

4. Write 2 brief arguments and explain the _claims_, _grounds_, and _warrants_ used.

* _claims_: A claim is what the author is trying to convince the audience of.
* _grounds_: The grounds of an argument are evidence that can be used to prove the claim.
* _warrants_: The warrants of an argument is the connection between the claims and grounds. Essentially, it is synthesizing the grounds into logical arguments for the claim.

Argument: My client is not guilty of hacking into the government's computer system because he has little to no computer programming experience.
Claims: My client is not guilty of hacking.
Grounds: He does not have computer programming experience.
Warrants: A person needs programming experience to be able to hack a government's computer system.

Argument: A small group of radical Congressmen should not allow the government to default on its debt because it will cause a global economic crisis.
Claims: The government should not be allowed to default of its debt.
Grounds: The government defaulting on its debt would cause a global economic crisis.
Warrants: The United States is a major part of the global economy. A lot of the world is based on the U.S. Dollar, which will significantly drop in value.

To me, this class has decimated a lot of stereotypes I had about writing and english courses in general. It never occurred to me that you could take a class that revolves around _The Simpsons_ and still learn how to form valid arguments.

In my mind, a good class is both interesting and informative — this is a hard balance to find. By using media that a lot of students are familiar with and showing how it applies to standard writing, this criteria is met.

_The Simpsons_ is a good example to use to teach how to form arguments. Because the show is essentially social satire, it takes arguments and preconceived notions and easily destroys them, making the audience question the long-standing beliefs we had. It shows just how weak the arguments that we've taken for granted really are, and shows us how to create better, stronger ones. Another good example would be _The Daily Show_ — Jon Stewart's satire of real news broadcasts show us just how ridiculous they really are.

This is what I believe you are trying to teach us — to not take what we see at face value and to form our own opinions about the world around us. For me, this has proven effective so far; I write and form arguments differently after only eight weeks of this class. Before, I used the standard high school formula of introduction paragraph with a thesis, three supporting paragraphs with one argument each, and a conclusion restating the thesis. Now, my writing is far more natural and free-flowing — it makes more sense to break the text into paragraphs rather than trying to fit everything into that formulaic structure.

What I think class has not helped with, however, is grammar. Given that this is an honors class, I should not think that these students need it. However, I believe it would be beneficial to simply correct the grammar in our essays and exams. I know that, despite my best intentions, I will have at least one grammar or spelling mistake in this exam. By knowing where that is, I will know to avoid that next time I write.

Overall, however, I feel that this course has improved how I write persuasively. By knowing the difference between a good and bad arguments, I am better able to persuade an audience of my opinion. This gives me a good foundation to start writing essays and papers for my classes in the future, and will serve me better in life.
