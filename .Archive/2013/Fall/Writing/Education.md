# Education

## _Whacking Day_

- "won mountain bikes", is a trick to get the troublemakers out of the way
- "we're sweeping you under the rug for the inspection"
- "will the superintendent kill me if I throw away the key" "no, but the PTA will rip you a new arse"
- it's not about appearance
- school's not there to educate children
- cut geography because students aren't doing well
- "expelled" "that's my boy!"
- "we put the fun in fundamentalist dogma!"
- "avert your eyes children, he may take on other forms!"
- whacking day was made up, people taking it for face value
- long-standing historical traditions
- pleasing authority
- protect snakes
- Bart goes back to school because of his independent learning
- "give them the bikes, and no one sues!"
- education is a problem
