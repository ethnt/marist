# Family Essay

Situation comedies, or sitcoms, have been around for many years.  _Leave it to Beaver_, _Father Knows Best_, and other pioneers in this space were almost formulaic, and had the same general format.

Sitcoms are cyclical in nature. This means that the status quo was maintained from episode to episode and there was no real story arc between episodes. An episode may have a disruption to the status quo, but this is generally resolved by the end of the episode and returned to how it was prior to the disruptions.

These shows also often reinforced a stereotype — that each member of the family had a specific role, and never deviated from that role. The father was head of the household, the mother took care of the kids, and the children would play around, go to school, and generally be very responsible. Often, the children got into some sort of situation, there was some drama, and everything worked out all right in the end and they were a happy family once more.

A good majority of sitcoms followed this format up until 1989 with the pilot of _The Simpsons_. _The Simpsons_ varied in a few different ways: most notably, it was one of the first popular animated sitcoms. At this point, animated shows were only considered appropriate for children — the mature subject matter of _The Simpsons_ quickly put that concern aside.

However, _The Simpsons_ was also different in the way it portrayed the typical American nuclear family. Eliezer Van Allen, an instructor at the University of California-Los Angeles, wrote in his article _The Simpsons: An Imperfect Ideal Family_ that _The Simpsons_ popularity is due to a "new and plausible representation of the American nuclear family in the personages of Homer, Marge, and their kids. (Van Allen)" Instead of the idealized, romanticized view of the nuclear family in older, stereotypical sitcoms such as _Leave it to Beaver_, _The Simpsons_ show the stark reality of family life.

This means that the best result does not come from each conflict or issue within the show, and not all is resolved by the end of the episode. Will Miller, a psychiatrist, believes that "Homer is as much of a butted today as he was in the first episode, and millions of people can relate to that, because they too had an imperfect parent, and they became better than their parent, like Lisa and Bart try to do. (Aucoin)" The family's morals develop, just as real families do, and that is something most people can relate to.

The characters are not just hollow stereotypes of the "typical" American family — they each have their own characteristics and values. For example, Homer is careless and buffoonish; Marge is a good mother; Bart is a troublemaker; Lisa is an activist. Though they do fit into certain archetypes, these archetypes are not often paired with these characters. Generally, the father is intelligent, commanding, and confident — these traits do not fit with Homer at all. Marge in general does not listen to Homer, which breaks the mold of the housewife. Bart is a troublemaker, but he often gets away with his stunts. And Lisa, as the daughter, is supposed to be subservient — yet, she stands up for what she believes in and is quite intelligent for her age.

However accurate this portrayal of the family the Simpsons are, there are certainly detractors. Bart is often seen as "corruptor of the American familial ideal. (Allen)" Many believe that Bart corrupted the whole generation that grew up with _The Simpsons_. Kids looked up to Bart as a model child, which he clearly was not. Homer is also criticized for being a terrible parental role model. Many believe his idiocy and unsupportive nature makes him blamed for many terrible parents.

However, it is these same imperfections that makes the Simpson family so reflective of the true American family. For example, the fathers in shows such as _Father Knows Best_ and _The Cosby Show_ are idealized, "impeccable" fathers.

Matt Groening, the creator of the show, is worried that "millions of Americans think that a good-humored, intelligent father can solve all the problems in a family. (Steiger)" However, Homer is a great example of how this is _not_ the case. It is certainly possible that there are fathers like Homer out there — in fact, it is more probable that this portrayal of the father figure rather than that of the idealized head of household.

It is abundantly clear that not every household fits that of the ideal American family. Every family has their quirks and squabbles, and the Simpsons are no different. Rather than show the idealized version of what a family _could_ be, it is far better for people to see the realistic version. Perhaps people could see the Simpson family's problems and then see and fix flaws within their own home, rather than aspiring to the unattainable perfect family.
