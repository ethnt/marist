### Gilbert & Sullivan

- Arthur Sullivan (composer)
- WH Gilbert (libretto)
- followed the farcical and satirical style of French composer Offenbach
- Sullivan was already a recognized composer of serious music â€” however, his expensive tastes required high income
- the 14 operettas they composed provided for that habit
- disguised their parodies in stories of pirates, Japanese girls, the navy, and amongst many other subjects
- Richard D'Oyly Carte produced and publicized the productions and together, they were very successful
