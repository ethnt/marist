# Franz Liszt

Franz Liszt was born on 22 October 1811 in the village of Doborján in the Kingdom of Hungary to Adam and Anna Liszt (né Lager). Adam was an accomplished musician — he learned cello under the tutelage of Joseph Haydn, was an amateur pianist, and played the organ and violin, as well as sung in a choir. He eventually got a job with the Esterházy family at a court in Eisenstadt, where we had the opportunity to work with many musicians and composers, including Beethoven. When he was transferred to the Esterházy estate of Raiding, he met Anna Lager, and they had one son, Franz.

By age six, Franz had began listening to his father's piano playing and showed an interest in many forms of music. Adam began teaching him at age seven, and Franz began composing when he was eight. By age nine, he appeared in concerts at Sophron and Pressburg. After these concerts, wealthy sponsors offered to finance Franz's music education.

Franz began to receive piano lessons from Carl Czerny, a former student of Beethoven and Hummel. He also received lessons from Antonio Salieri in composition, and eventually had his public debut in Vienna at a concert at the Landständischer Saal.

When his father died in 1827, Franz moved to Paris and lived with his mother for the next five years. To cover his expenses, he began teaching piano lessons. The next year, he fell in love with one of his pupils, Caroline de Saint-Cricq, the daughter of Charles X's minister of commerce, whose father insisted that the entire affair be broken off. Because of this, Liszt fell very ill, and underwent a long period of religious doubts. He also worked hard to overcome is deprivation of general education, and eventually met leading authors and artists of the day, including Victor Hugo, Heinrich Heine, and Alphonse de Lamartine.

He met and began a relationship with the Countess Marie d'Agoult in 1833. With the influence of her and Felicité de Lamennais, Liszt's creative output increased dramatically. After the birth of his two daughters and a son, he took up touring again to raise money for a Beethoven monument in Bonn. The sheer amount of appearances he made was extraordinary — he performed three or four times a week over an eight year period, thus appearing more than one thousand times. This created "Lisztomania", a Beatles-like hysteria over Liszt. He made a good amount of money, but a large portion went to charity and humanitarian causes.

He tried (in vain) to marry the Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, and was led into a period of sadness — his son and daughter also died in this period. He eventually began what he called "vie trifurquée", or his traveling between Rome, Weimar, and Budapest to teach, compose, and perform.

On 31 July 1886, Liszt died in Bayreuth, Germany from pneumonia.

As a composer, Liszt produced an enormous amount of works. He is best known for his piano music, but he also wrote for other musical arrangements.

Because Liszt had a near-virtuosic capacity as a piano player, his works were enormously difficult. One of the most famous is his _La Campanella_ [1], which influenced many later pianists. He also wrote and performed _Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2_ [2] — the fast section is still played today. During his recitals, he was a great showman, and brought the public's attention to music. Lisztomania was the first movement of it's kind — the only other public hysteria over music was much later with The Beatles. 

Liszt was also fascinated with poems and literary works. He was one of the first composers to create program music (music that was based off of a literary piece). Good examples of this are his symphonic poems, especially his _Faust Symphony_ [3]. This inspired Berlioz to begin writing program music himself, which led to his creation of the _Symphonie fantastique_.
