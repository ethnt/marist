# 19th-Century Music: Final Exam

## Vocal Music

The most well-known vocal music of the 19th century was lieder. "Lied" is a German word meaning "art song". These compositions are written to a accompany a poem — this adds drama and emotion to the text. The source poems were selected from established poets, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich Heine, and Wilhelm Muller — these poets were the German equivalents of Byron and Keats.

This idea was rather new: up until the lied, solo singers had only been heard in operatic pieces. Opera still existed of course but these soloists were often accompanied by full orchestras. With lieder, the soloists were often performing without any accompaniment at all — if there was any accompaniment, it was very minimal piano to only enhance the performer.

There are three forms of lieder: strophic, where each verse or stanza has the same melody; through composed, where there is no repetition of music; and modified strophic, where all but one verse is the same music. These pieces could also be arranged into song cycles.

Perhaps the most influential composer in the area of lieder was Franz Schubert. Schubert was an Austrian composer who wrote almost 600 lieder in his lifetime, as well as eight symphonies and chamber music.

_Die Erlkönig_, or _The Elf King_ is one of his most well-known pieces. Based on a dramatic poem by Goethe, the soloist is required to perform four individual parts, playing the narrator, father, son, and the Erlking. Each part is in a different register, requiring tremendous skill from the often-male performer.

_Die Forelle_, or _The Trout_ is another well-known lied. It is noteworthy because it is considered onomatopoeic — the words sound like what they mean. It is in a classical style, but is still within the Romantic era.

Another famous lied composer was Robert Schumann — while he also produced many piano pieces, concertos, sonatas, and symphonies, there was also a period in which he composed lied that was comparable to Schubert's. Most notably, he wrote a 16 song song-cycle _Dichterliebe_ that was set to poems by Heinrich Heine.

This lieder created the foundation for much of Romantic music. The idea of having a piece of literature or other work to base music on instead of having a standalone piece was extremely influential.

## Piano Music

- Liszt
- Gottschalk
- Schumann
- Chopin

Piano music in the 19th century was greatly enhanced by technical improvements that made it the concert grand piano it is today. They began to produce the instruments in factories with a strong metal frame. This allowed for a larger range of notes, adding two more octaves.

Salon music was becoming popular at this time as well. Because of the rather compact size of the piano compared to orchestra groups, it was a perfect choice for intimate settings. Many other genres were being adapted to piano, such as Viennese waltzes, polonaise, and Polish mazurkas. This made what were very heavy pieces into accessible compositions with a wider appeal.

One of the most well-known composers for piano of the 19th century with Frédéric Chopin. He is one of the forefathers of modern piano music, and wrote some pieces that are now central to the pianists' repertoire.

Chopin wrote for the salon, so he had a very intimate style. The music spanned a wide range of emotions, including melancholy, joy, capricious, and meditative. His music was characterized by a heavy use of ornaments, but most notably his use of rubato.

Rubato is rhythmic flexibility within a phrase or measure. This was common in the 19th century Romantic movement, but it also influenced modern day jazz performance.

Some of his most famous compositions include _Military Polonaise in A Major_ and the _Funeral March_.

Louis Moreau Gottschalk was another important piano composer and performer. A creole native of New Orleans, he was influenced by traditional West Indian and African-American music in Congo Square. The rhythmic nature of these folk songs carried over into his compositions. _Tournament Galop_ was his first real hit, followed by _Le Banjo_.

Finally, Franz Liszt was perhaps the most famous pianist of the period. A virtuoso, Liszt toured Europe to raise money for both himself and a Beethoven monument in Bonn. The sheer amount of appearances he made was extraordinary — he performed three or four times a week of an eight year period, appearing more than 1000 times. He created "Lisztomania", a Beatles-like hysteria.

The works he produced were enormously difficult but also influential to later pianists — _La Campanella_ and _Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2_. It effectively brought music to the masses, not just the wealthy upper classes.

In addition to bringing music to the masses, piano music in the Romantic era influenced later pieces rhythmically. Gottschalk and Chopin created new styles and were expressive with their music, to the point where you could determine the meaning of the piece through its onomatopoeic qualities alone.

## Opera

- Verdi
- Wagner

Classical opera had two forms — opera seria (serious opera), and opera buffo (comic opera). Opera seria included two forms of singing: recicative (dialogue), and aria (a song).

Giuseppe Verdi was the champion of Italian opera — many of his works made their way into public consciousness, especially "La donna è mobile" from _Rigoletto_ and "Libiamo ne' lieti calici" ("The Drinking Song") from _La traviata_.

However Richard Wagner, a German composer who created the music drama genre, blended theater and music completely and created what we consider the modern opera.

Wagner is the most significant composer of the Romantic era — so much so that the era is split into pre-Wagner and post-Wagner. His views, values, literature, and lifestyle were like none other before him — however, with this came a remarkable arrogance.

He created what he called "gesamtkunstwerk", or "a total work of art unifying all elements", which came to define his aesthetic. Wagner wrote the libretto and music to his operas, and often based them off of Germanic legends.

Part of gesamtkunstwerk included use of leitmotifs, or musical motifs portraying a character, scene, place, or relationship. This was characteristic of Wagner's pieces, and made it easy for the audience to recognize characters and themes on stage.

Other characteristics of Wagner include a complete lack of arias in favor of recitative. This created a continuous piece of drama that was uninterrupted by long musical solos. He also heavily used chromatic dissonance to create a sense of heightened emotion without a tonal center, a resolve, or relief.

His operas, especially his _Ring_ cycle was influential in that it laid the foundation for modern drama and musicals — it almost reinvented the art form with gesamtkunstwerk.

## Program Music

- Berlioz
- Saint-Saëns
- Brahms

Program music is a type of music that aims to recreate a work in another media (usually literature) through music. The aim was to invoke more emotion and enhance the reading of the text through other senses.

One of the most notable composers to write program music was Hector Berlioz. His _Symphonie fantastique_, a symphony about a young artist falling in love, characterized Romantic program music. The program that came with the performance was also written by Berlioz — he himself was also a prolific writer, leading to a generation of other writer-composers.

Another important program music composer was Camille Saint-Saëns. While he did not write a specific program for his pieces, his titles often were descriptive enough for the short snippets of chamber music. His _Carnival of the Animals_ are considered the pinnacle of descriptive chamber music — movements like _Voliére_, _Le cygnet, _Tortues_, and _L'éléphant_ barely need a title.

Hand in hand with lieder and operatic works, the concept of basing music on other media led the way for other modern forms of music such as musical theater.

## Operetta

- Offenbach
- Gilbert and Sullivan

From opera came another genre of program music and musical theater — operetta. Focused on satire and humor, operetta was a form of light opera that came from opera buffo.

The most influential operetta composer was Jacques Offenbach. He was successful in bringing operetta to the forefront of the public consciousness — his shows were often very racy and erotic.

Operetta was one of the first forms of music and theater to criticize society. The grotesque way Offenbach portrayed French politics and society was striking and certainly angered a lot of people. However, all this did was cause more people to go to see his shows. In fact, a scathing review by Jules Janin, a critic for the _Journal des Débats_, intrigued so many people, Offenbach needed to move his play company to another theatre to accommodate the influx of new theatre-goers.

Many of his operettas have entered the public consciousness, especially _Orphées des enfers_, who's "Can Can" dance is known by most.

At the same time, the English counterparts to Offenbach W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan were creating comic operas. The sheer ridiculousness of the worlds that Gilbert & Sullivan created were very appealing to the English public.

Many operettas survive and continue to be performed today. _The Pirates of Penzance_, _H.M.S. Pinafore_, and _The Mikado_ are all excellent satires on the society in which they lived, but are also considered the bridge between the older operas and today's modern musicals.
