## Periods

1. Classical period
2. Exploration into music containing 19th century characteristics
3. String quartets, final symphony, use of chromatic harmonies, use of choir with orchestra

### Classical

#### 1st Symphony (1799-1800)

* showing sounds of originality by starting on the dominant 7th chord &rarr; tonic chord (instead of starting on a tonic chord, he starts on dominant chord [5th chord])
* very similar to Mozart (rhythmic, homophonic accompaniment)

#### 2nd Symphony (1802)

* hearing was diminishing
* the "happy" and "sunny" tonality attributed to his need to be hopeful that his hearing would return

### Middle

#### 3rd Symphony, _Eroica_ (1804)

* originally titled _Bonaparte_, but upon realizing the tyranny of Napoleon's self-imposed rule as Emperor, Beethoven renamed the piece _Eroica_ (heroic)

* turning point in size of composition
