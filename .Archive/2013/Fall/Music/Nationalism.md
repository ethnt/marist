# Nationalism

- nationalism in music was a new approach that began in the 19th century
- it came from countries that felt compelled to be connected to their traditions and customs, and most of all, to the people, the "folk"
- it was from countries that were suppressed, rules by a foreign body, a dictatorship that nationalism in music was heard
- countries outside of Europe such as Bohemia, Russia, Spain, and Hungary, all produced nationalistic composers
- composers themselves would embody the folk music style within their compositions
- _different_ composing style to those that would feature established folk music styles such as in Chopin's mazurkas and Liszt's rhapsodies

## Russia

- until the 19th century, Russia had not established any "great" composers
- the government did not look upon music with the same importance as art or literature
- only music heard until this time was Italian, especially opera

### Mikhail Glinka (1804 &ndash; 1857)

- Glinka began writing music in a westernized manner
- after traveling through Italy and Berlin, he wrote _A Life for the Czar_

#### _A Life for the Czar_

- subject matter was based on a national hero who was a peasant
- based on Ivan Sussanin, a peasant who saved many people from being killed by misleading the Polish army at the risk of his own life
- highly regarded, as there was no Russian music written of the caliber before
