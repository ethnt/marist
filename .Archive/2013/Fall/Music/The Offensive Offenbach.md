# The Offensive Offenbach

Jacques Offenbach was born as Jacob Offenbach to a synagogue cantor in Cologne, Germany on 20 June 1819. He was taught by his father Isaac to play the violin at age six, and within two years he was composing songs and dances. By the age of nine, he had chosen the cello as his instrument of choice and took up lessons with the cellist Bernhard Breuer. Within three years, he was giving performances of his own compositions, "the technical difficulties of which terrified his master" [1]. Together with his brother Julius on violin and his sister Isabella on piano, Jacob played at local dance halls, inns, and cafés, performing popular music. By 1883, his father decided to send his two most musically gifted children (Julius and Jacob) to study in Paris.

Even with the two young musician's talents, it was difficult for  Isaac to persuade director of the Paris Conservatoire, Luigi Cherubini, to give Julius and Jacob an audition. Cherubini was biased against eastern-European and German entrants — he had event refused Franz Liszt admission a few years previously. He eventually relented and listened to Jacob and Julius play, and both were admitted to the Conservatoire. Both brothers decided to adopt the French form of their names: Julius became Jules, and Jacob became Jacques.

While at the Conservatoire, Jules was a voracious student and eventually graduated and became a successful violin teacher and conductor. Meanwhile, Jacques was bored by his academics and left on his own volition on 2 December 1834, merely a year after he first began.

Having struck out on his own, Offenbach also had to start providing for himself. He had a few temporary jobs in theatre orchestras, but eventually became a cellist at the Opéra-Comique in 1835. His earnings here were small, but enough for him to take lessons with the celebrated cellist Louis-Pierre Norblin. He also took composition and orchestration lessons from Fromental Halévy. Though his end goal was to compose for the stage, he did not have a foothold in that industry quite yet. With the help of Friedrich von Flotow, another young composer, he started to build his reputations composing and performing for the salons of Paris.

He frequently appeared at the salon of the comtesse de Vaux, where he met Hérminie d'Alcain. Through her connections, Offenbach made performances across Europe and England, including appearances with musicians such as Mendelssohn and Liszt.

When he returned from his tour, he had a much better reputation and had money with which to marry Hérminie. He began touring the Paris salons once more, but this time as not a cellist who also composed, but a composer who played the cello. He started to create musical burlesques as part of his salon presentations, beginning with a parody of Félicien David's _Le désert_. He was very nearly about to break into the theatre scene when France's 1848 Revolution swept through the Parisian streets, causing him to flee with Hérminie and his newly-born daughter back to Cologne.

He returned to Paris in February of 1849, but he found that the grand salons had closed down. He became a conductor at the Opéra-Comique, and later musical director of the Comédie Française. Here, he composed songs and incidental music for eleven classical and modern dramas. However, the management remained uninterested in commissioning him to compose for its stage.

Offenbach wrote three one-act operettas between 1853 and 1855, and he had them staged in Paris. The were well received, but the management of the Opéra-Comique still was hesitant in staging an opera of his own. However, the composer, singer, and impresario Florimond Ronger (known as Hervé), agreed to let Offenbach present a one-act operetta at his new theatre Folies-Nouvelle. _Oyayaye ou La reine de îles_, with words by Jules Moinaux, opened on 26 June 1855 to critical acclaim.

He was encouraged by this success to open his own theatre at the Salle Lacaze with is new group, Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens. In order to open for the 1855 Great Exhibition, Offenbach had a little under a month to equip the theatre, recruit actors, create the orchestra, hire staff, find authors to write the material, and compose the music. He was able to recruit Ludovic Halévy, a respectable civil servant with a passion for theatre to write the libretto. Halévy went on to work with Offenbach for 24 years.

They opened with _Les deux aveugles_[2], a comedy about two beggars faking blindness. It opened to much acclaim, and was very popular. Along with _Le violoneux_, the theatre was very popular int he summer of 1855. However, because of the theatre's location in the Champs–Élysées, the public would not venture to see a show in the Parisian winter. Offenbach set out to find a suitable venue and found the Théâtre des Jeue Élèves at the Salle Choiseul in central Paris. He moved the Bouffes-Parisiens there for the winter and had summer performances at the Salle Lacaze. By March 1861, all performances were at the Salle Lacaze.

Here, Offenbach composed _Ba-ta-clan_, Rossini's _Il signor Bruschino_, Mozart's _Der Schausieldirektor_ as _L'impresario_, and all were greatly popular — even the emperor Napoleon III requested a performance at Tuileries.

Despite these successes, Offenbach was very extravagant with his theatre and was constantly on the verge of bankruptcy. To avoid this, he split his group in two and had one perform at the St. James's Theatre in the West End of London and another continue performing at Salle Choiseul.

By 1858, Offenbach was able to present his first full-length operetta, _Orphée aux enfers_ [3]. This led to the first real outrage against his works — Jules Janin, critic of the _Journal des Débats_, condemned the piece for profanity and irreverence. Offenbach seized upon the free publicity and engaged in a debate against Janin in the newspaper _Le Figaro_. The public was intrigued by such an operetta, and the box office takings from subsequent performances were prodigious.

Offenbach flourished in the 1860's — he performed for the Prussian Emperor Franz Joseph, and produced such operettas such as _Le pont des soupirs_, _La belle Hélène_, _La vie parisienne_, and _La Périchole_. Once again, Janin criticized the performances as vulgar, and he again assured the successes of the pieces.

In 1867, Offenbach had his greatest success — _Le Grande-Duchesse de Géroldstein_ [4], a satire on militarism that took place two days after the opening of the Paris Exhibition. Despite the looming threat of Prussia, Offenbach poked fun at the oncoming war with the King of Prussia and his chief minister Otto van Bismarck in attendance.

Soon after, war did break out in the Franco-Prussian War, and he quickly returned home to Étretat and arranged for his family to be moved to the safety in San Sebastián in northern Spain. Having been lauded by Napoleon III, his work fell out of favor when the regime crumbled under the Prussians. A heavy anti-German sentiment swept across France, and many of his pieces were seen as worthless. During this time, he became very popular in Great Britain, and gave performances in Wales and London. By 1871, he was able to return to Paris, but his new pieces were not nearly as successful as his previous ones. A revival of _Orphée aux enfers_ was profitable, but a collaboration with the dramatist Victorien Sardou led to bankruptcy.

He was able to travel to the United States to play at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876, and gave over 40 concerts in New York and Philadelphia. He returned to France in July with profits that were enough to pay off some of his debt and keep enough for his family.

In 1877, he began working on his first serious opera, _Les contes d'Hoffmann_. Having been stricken by gout since the late 1860's, he did not live to finish the piece. It was finished by his 18-year-old son Auguste along with a family friend, Ernest Guiraud. He died in Paris in 1880 at the age of 61.

Many of Offenbach's operettas were seen as ridiculous mockeries of European life. It satirized everything about the current political systems, including that of Napoleon III and Prussia. Along with these satires, he created what many saw as vulgar and inappropriate acts. Many of his pieces influenced the cabaret culture of the 1900's, but at the time, the performances were scene as almost pornographic.

One of the most famous scenes that had this characteristic was _Le Galop_ from _Orphée aux enfers_ [5]. It features what was considered scantily-clad women flipping their skirts up and around, and in general acting salaciously. At the time, nothing like this had been seen before. Though France was one of the more progressive cultures, it was still outrageous to have this form of dress.
