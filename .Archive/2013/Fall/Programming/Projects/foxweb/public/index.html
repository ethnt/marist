				<h2>Biography</h2>
				<p>My name's Ethan, and I'm a first-year computer science major at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York.</p>
				<p>I've been interested in computers since a very young age. I created my first website with HTML in 6th grade, and from there, I learned CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and eventually Ruby.</p>
				<p>For my senior capstone project in high school, I created Noted, a tool for students to organize their research. Along with Noted, I'm creating Recall, a simple planner for students so they can keep track of their assignments.</p>
				<p>There are various projects of mine <a href="https://github.com/eturk">on GitHub</a>. Nearly all of my work is open source, for anyone to use.</p>
