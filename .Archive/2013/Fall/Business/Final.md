# Introduction to Business and Management: Final Exam

1. Looking at the two groups that you were in this semester, compare each group on the phases of development that you observed in each group. Identify the group members. Determine which role each member played in the group. What behavior did you see each team member play as the group developed?

The first group I was with for the business plan project included Alysa, Phil, Dan, and Bex. I was with them for a much longer period of time, and thus we developed much farther as a group. The first time we met, I remember how uncomfortable we were with each other — we had an almost cold demeanor, and were laser-focused on the task at hand. We were in the forming stage, where we "engaged in behaviors such as defining the initial assignment, discussing how to divvy up the necessary tasks, understand the broad scope and objectives of the project,t and learning about the resources (time equipment, personnel) available to the team as it works to complete the project (de Janasz 223)."

At this point, some differences of opinion began to arise. We tip-toed around conflict, not wanting to disturb or anger the other person. This was the storming stage, when "feelings emerge such as resistance to the task or approach being taken by the group, resentment about differences in workload, anger about roles and responsibilities, and changed in attitude about the group or toward individual group members and concerns (de Janasz 223)." This was especially prevalent with Bex — his lack of English-speaking and -writing skills was a limiting factor in his ability to participate with the group. Some resentment built as he fell further behind.

However, once we spoke to him about his role, the tensions began to lessen and we became at ease with each other. We could now joke around with each other, and we were becoming friends in a sense. This was the norming stage, when "members feel a new ability to express constructive criticism; they feel part of a working team and a sense of relief that everything will work out (de Janasz 224)."

At this point, roles began to develop — Alysa assumed a leadership role, and we began to be very efficient at getting being able to finish the work as quickly and accurately as possible. We were at the performing stage — we had worked through our differences. We were making decisions on our own to benefit the group as well. We took the initiative to proceed in the project.

And finally, once the work was done and we were assigned a new group, we were at the adjourning stage. We were all a bit disappointed because we were efficient as a team and we were comfortable around each other. This meant starting over with another group of people.

When I was assigned to my new group of Megan, Siena, James, and Lauren, we immediately got down to business. We decided in class that we didn't need to meet outside of class, since all of the questions could be divided among us and answered. Megan took a leadership role, but only to the extent that she created the Google Drive document that we shared to answer the questions. We were mostly at ease with each other from the get-go: there weren't any clear stages of development, since we were together for such a short amount of time.

The two groups were quite different — because we were together for a much longer time, the first group was much more at ease with each other. However, because it was the beginning of the year and four out of five of us were also adapting to college life, it was a shakier start. With the second group, we were already used to life at college and in the classroom, so it was easier for us to get working quicker.

2. Discuss the role of facilitator. What tool did your group have to use to help with group facilitation?

Facilitation is "the set of 'activities carried out before, during, and after meetings to help a group achieve its own outcomes.' (de Janasz 283)" In our groups, the leader or facilitator would be the one who said "we need to get to work". This would mean either creating the Google Drive document to work on, or booking the library study room for us to use. He or she would also look over and finalize the work the group did and submit it.

We had a few tools to help with facilitation. Namely, the team contract kept us on track. It set out requirements for us, and we were obliged to stick to them. The penalty of violating this contract was a lesser percentage of the final grade. We only had to use this once.

4. Why would the business plan include a SWOT?

A business plan would include a SWOT diagram — a diagram showing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats — because it gives an indicator of what the company is currently doing and what it can do. While it is not a replacement for a business plan, it also serves as a good summary of what will be emphasized.

A company would enhance the strengths they have currently. That's what they should capitalize on and move forward to in the future. This also encompasses the company's opportunities — while these should be in line with their strengths, they are not necessarily the same thing.

The weaknesses are what the company is not doing well at this point in time. The threats can enhance these weakness and harm the company. The organization should then do whatever they can to minimize both the weaknesses and threats.
