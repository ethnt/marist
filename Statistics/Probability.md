# Probability

* **empirical probability**: based on previous evidence (# event occurrences / # of trials)

---

1. For any event _E_, the probability of _E_ = 0 ≤ P(_E_) ≤ 1
2. Probability of P should = 1.
3. P(not _E_) = 1 - P(_E_)
4. P(_E_ or _F_) = P(_E_) + P(_F_)
5. P(_E_ and _F_) = P(_E_) * P(_F_)

---

- P(E|B) = P(E and B) / P(B)
- P(A|B) * P(B) = P(A and B) (non-independent events)

---

To see if two events are independent:

- P(E|F) = P(E)
- P(F|E) = P(F)
