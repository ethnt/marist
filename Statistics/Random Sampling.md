# Random Sampling

### Simple Random Sample

1. Decide on population, parameter to be estimated, and sample size.
2. Find a frame for your population.
3. Number individuals.
4. Use random numbers to select who you will poll.

### Stratified Sample

1. You think some variable will affect the results of your survey (e.g., gender, political party).
2. Each category of the variable defines a stratum.
3. Do a simple random sample for each stratum.

### Cluster Sample

1. Frames come broken into clusters.
2. Put into one or more clusters at random.
3. Poll everyone in cluster.

### Systematic Sample

1. Number the frame.
2. Calculate _k_ (_N_ / _n_).
3. Pick a starting number randomly.
4. Count down by _k_.
