# Philosophy of Science

- big questions about the world and our place in it
- philosophy and science are hard to define
- **Karl Popper**: philosopher tried to define science ("makes claims that are falsifiable; they don't make points that are empirically made")
- we want to distinguish real science from pseudoscience
- valuing practical application of real sciences
- science sets the agenda, given a cognitive priority
- philosophy of science helps us understand the place of science in society
- there are periods of revolutionary science and normal science
- **paradigm**: a model for things (e.g., an overarching set of assumptions about how science should be practiced)
- anomalies cause paradigm shifts that move one scientific model to another (e.g., Copernicus saying that the sun is the center of the solar system)
- it requires a "leap of faith" to move from paradigm one to two; they cannot be compared
- **relativism**: can take place in terms of epistemic or moral relativism; truth is relative to the individual or a culture; creates diversity and tolerance (Snyder believes it's dangerous, that there's a one truth and some things are just plain wrong)
- **epistemology**: theory of knowledge

#### Examples of Revolutions

- Copernican Revolution
- Industrial Revolution
- _Origin of Species_
- Genetics

***

- **extrinsic value** (**instrumental value**): we need something for its consequences (water, food, money, education); education is cornerstone for most, because quality of life is better
- **intrinsic value**: we need something for its aesthetic value; like something for its own sake
- **skepticism**: cautiousness about previously held beliefs; dogmatism; opposite of knee-jerk belief
- **counterexample**: you should think about the counterexample to your own point
- someone disagreeing with you is a sign of respect, they're taking your point seriously
- **demarcation criterion**: a line in the sand; for science, what is science, what is pseudoscience?
- **necessary and sufficient conditions**: when you state the n&s conditions for something to see if something fits those conditions or not; necessity (_P_ is necessary for _Q_ when _P_ must be true for _Q_ to be true) is required for sufficiency (so _Q_ needs _P_ to be true to be true, but _P_ could be true and _Q_ can not be); for example, you could have the required 120 credits to graduate, but you could not have the sufficient requirements (like not enough core)
- where something came from is important to knowing what it is
- **method of discovery**: how it came to be (who? where? when?)
- **method of justification**: a math textbook gives you this, but not where is came from (why?)
- method of discovery is not important to method of justification
- modern science was born out of philosophy and philosophers (Newton, Copernicus, Galileo, Leibniz, Descartes); they all like math, atomism (atoms and the space in which they exist)
