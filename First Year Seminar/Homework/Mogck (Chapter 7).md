# Mogck: Chapter 7

- reading makes you more human
- by trying to justify our beliefs and practices we will hold fewer false beliefs, conduct ourselves more rationally, and conduct ourselves more justly

1. You should use intertextuality to form your own arguments
2. There are questions that have not been answered, but there are some that don't need to be answered
3. "There are beliefs that are important to you that you may not yet be prepared to defend with adequate reasons."
4. You have to read philosophical texts at least twice to understand them

- "to learn from someone, you have to trust them"
- there are some beliefs that you have that you can't prove; you want to provide adequate defense for your beliefs
- philosophers are tough critics, but use their criticism
- come to class prepared
- don't ask stupid questions (expectations for papers, content of exams, grades, why philosophy is hard — I think this is a bullshit point)
- we need to actually understand what we're saying before we say it
- philosophy is hard because they keep asking "why?"
- philosophy is hard to read because of vernacular, what they're talking about was a debate at the time of writing and not now, and lack of hindsight (given that they are _our_ hindsight)
- we study the past to subject our concepts and justifications to scrutiny (e.g., we may need to reform our morals about embryos with the abortion debate, conduct of a criminal in relation to their punishment)
- "One hopes that in doing philosophy we hope to study philosophy to correct our views, hold fewer false beliefs, and make better, more rational choices (Mogck 87)."
- "I am entitled to my own opinion" is bullshit — "being _entitled_ to something means having a _legitimate_ claim to something, having a _right_ to it that others are obligated to respect (Mogck 88)."
- "Is it true as a matter of fact (or true by definition) that every belief I hold is legitimate just because I happen to hold it? Do I have adequate justification for every one of my important beliefs? Are other people bound to respect me as a rational and decent person no matter what I believe? The answer in each case is, plainly 'No.' (Mogck 88)"
- "Being entitled and justified are properties that a person acquires only by successfully providing rational support for his or her views (Mogck 88)."
- saying "I am entitled to my own opinion" may just be a way to politely exit a conversation — this is fine, just don't confuse it with the literal meaning
- **moral relativism**: the view that are no universally-valid moral principles, no moral facts that would make moral judgments objectively true or false
