# Okasha: Chapter 1

- when asking what science is, you're asking for a common feature that all subjects that are considered sciences share
- some sciences require experimentation (chemistry, physics), while some rely on observation (astronomy)
- scientists want to explain things in terms of a general theory
- science is taught in an ahistorical way — there is little mention of how these discoveries came to be
- origins of modern science are from a period of rapid scientific development in Europe between 1500 and 1750 (the scientific revolution)
- Copernican Revolution was the first step — within 100 years after its introduction in 1542, it was the establish scientific orthodoxy (despite pushback from the Catholic Church in particular)
- Galileo completely conflicted with Aristotelian cosmology
- Galileo was the first truly modern physicist (the first to show that the language of mathematics couldd be used to describe the behavior of actual objects in the material world, such as falling bodies and projectiles)
- the scientific revolution culminated with Newton (he was able to explain other older theories quantitatively)
- "Scientists accepted Newton's conception as essentially correct; all that remainder to be done was to fill in the details (Okasha 8)."
- confidence in the Newtonian picture was shattered by relativity and quantum mechanics (does not apply to massive objects or subatomic particles)
- Darwin contributed massively to biology by introducing evolution
- Watson and Crick also contributed with structure of DNA and started molecular biology
- looking at science from a philosophical perspective allows us to uncover assumptions that are implicit in scientific practice, but which scientists do not explicitly discuss
- part of the job of philosophy of science is to question assumptions that scientists take for granted
- "Karl Popper, an influential 20th-century philosopher of science, thought that the fundamental feature of a scientific theory is that it should be falsifiable. To call a theory falsifiable is not to say that it is false. Rather, it means that the theory makes some definite predictions that are capable of being tested against experience. If these predictions turn out to be wrong, then the theory has been falsified, or disproved (Okasha 13)."
- "Popper thought that some supposedly scientific theories did not satisfy this condition and thus did not deserve to be called science at all; rather they were merely pseudo-science (Okasha 13)."
- Popper believes that Freud's theories are unfalsifiable because they can be rendered compatible with any clinical data whatsoever
- Marx's theories are also unfalsifiable because of Marxist's tendency to make _ad hoc_ explanations as to why current events are consistent with their theories
- Einstein's theories are falsifiable because he makes very precise predictions which are confirmed by observation
- however, Popper is wrong under some circumstances — Newton made a prediction, which proved to be slightly wrong; Adams and Leverrier delved deeper and saw that Newton's gravitational theory was skewed because of the presence of a previously unknown planet (Neptune)
- "...virtually every theory in science conflicts with some observations — finding a theory that fits all the data perfectly is extremely difficult (Okasha 16)."
