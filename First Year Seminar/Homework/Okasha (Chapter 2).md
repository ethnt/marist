- **deductive inference**: where if premisses are true, then the conclusion must be true as well; the existence of an appropriate relation between premises and conclusion, namely that if the premisses are true, the conclusion must be true too

> The first five eggs in the box were rotten
> All the eggs have the same best-before date stamped on them
> Therefore, the sixth egg will be rotten too

- **inductive inference**: we are making assumptions about objects we haven't examined
- this is like saying "because when I drive and I turn the wheel to the left, the car will go left, therefore it will now as well"
- scientists use inductive reasoning whenever they move from limited data to a more general conclusion
- the word "proof" is restricted to deductive inferences, given that you can't _know_ for certain about an inductive inference
- by using inductive inference, we presuppose the "uniformity of nature"; this means that inductive inference is not rational
- **uniformity of nature**: that something will happen because it always works that way
- **inference to the best explanation**: a type of inductive inference
- **frequency interpretation of probability**: the equating of probability with proportions, or frequencies
