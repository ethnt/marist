# Richard Wagner (1813-1883)

* most significant composer of the Romantics (Romantic period is split into pre-Wagner and post-Wagner)
* operas are unequal to any that came before
* his values, views, words (literature), and lifestyle were like that of no other
* he had such a high degree of self-importance that he was considered arrogant to many
* considered himself so revolutionary and above all others that he truly believed the world was at his disposal
* was in debt quite a bit
* not successful until he wrote his first successful opera _Rienzi_ at age 30
* hard-core German (influence Nazi ideals)
* believed in the Aryan race; anti-Semite
* studied Beethoven extensively, believed _9th Symphony_ was most important piece ever written
* did not play an instrument, studied scores to understand composition

## _Gesamtkunstwerk_

* "a total work of art unifying all elements"
* wrote his own libretto (story, words) and music
* "leitmotif" (musical motif portraying a character, scene, place, or relationship; became a common method for score writing for film music)

## Music Dramas

* no arias, no ensemble pieces
* continuous piece of drama
* used chromatic dissonance, creating a sense of heightened emotion (no tonal center, no resolve, no relief)

## Opera Themes

* all based on ancient folklore and mythology
* (maybe) influenced J.R.R. Tolkein

## Works

* _The Ring_ cycle
