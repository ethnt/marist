# From Classical to Romantic

* many continued from the classical era

## Romantic Orchestra

* size increased
* concert halls more appropriate, available
* many of instruments developed technically (valves on brass instruments)
* new instruments (tubular bells, tuba, cor anglais, contra bassoon)

## Romantic Symphony

* melodies more lyrical, nationalistic influences, colorful harmonies
* the form did not change a great deal
* symphonies still used four movement form with the first using Sonata-Allegro, the second being slow in variation, and theme form, third being quick in 3/4 and the fourth being a finale, balancing the first

### Absolute Orchestral Music

* **absolute music**: music that has no secondary elemtn needed to accompany the music (such as program notes)
* it is "purely music"
* it may contain influences and nationalistic themes, but nothing additional is needed in order to listen to it

### Brahms and the Romantic Symphony

* Johannes Brahms is to the Romantic era what Verdi is to the Romantic era opera
* he continued the symphony tradition on in its true form as absolute orchestral music
* he is the romantic symphony composer and is often compared to Beethoven in his grandeur
