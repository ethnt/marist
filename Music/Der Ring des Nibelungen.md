# Richard Wagner's _Der Ring des Nibelungen_

_Der Ring des Nibelungen_ was a cycle of four operas by German composer Richard Wagner. The title translated to _The Ring of the Nibelung_, and is commonly referred to as the _Ring Cycle_ or simply _The Ring_. It is the story of a magic ring that grants the power to rule the world. This is based on a variety of myths and folk tales — Old Norse, Icelandic, and German stories directly influenced the content of _The Ring_.

The cycle is split into four parts: _Das Rheingold_ (_The Rhine Gold_), _Die Walküre_ (_The Valkyrie_), _Siegfried_, and _Götterdämmerung_ (_Twilight of the Gods_). Typically, one part is performed a night, so a performance of the entire cycle will be over four nights. In total, these four performances last about 15 hours, depending on the pace of the conductor.

In 1849 while in exile in Switzerland, Wagner first described his idea of _gesamtkunstwerk_ in the essay _The Artwork of the Future_. _Gesamtkunstwerk_, or "total work of art", is the unification of arts such as music, song, dance, poetry, the visual arts, and stagecraft. He further expanded on this ideal in _Opera and Drama_, and attempted to explain his political and artistic ideas to justify the libretti he was working on at the time — _The Nibelung Myth as Sketch for a Drama_. This text had a similar plot to the eventual _Ring_ cycle, but with some major differences. Later, he wrote a libretto titled _Siegfrieds Tod_ (_Sigfried's Death_). From this, Wagner wrote a prelude called _Der munge Siegfriend_ (_The Young Siegried_, later rnamed to simply _Siegfried_). By October of of 1851, he had decided to create a cycle of four operas. Over the next year, he finished the libretto and music for all four operas, finishing in December of 1852.

At this point in his life, Wagner was heavily in debt. Despite this, he had aspirations to build his own opera hall so he could "correctly" perform his new opera. It was not until 1871 that he had sufficient interest and money to begin building his opera house in Bayreuth, Germany. By 1875, the hall was complete, and the _Ring_ cycle was played in its entirety for the first time at the 1876 Festspielhaus, a music festival dedicated solely to Wagner.

Many people who attended the first Festival, including his close friend Friedrich Nietzsche, were struck by the amount of German nationalism that was instilled into the opera. In fact, it is known that Adolf Hitler was an admirer of Wagner's works, especially the _Ring_ cycle. The poem that the cycle is based on, _Nibelungenlied_, had been hailed by German romantics as the "German national epic". His antisemitic views are also represented within the operas by the Mime character.

Throughout the opera, Wagner heavily used leitmotifs to designate certain themes or characters. Perhaps the most famous of these is the theme _Walkürenritt_ (_Ride of the Valkyries_)[3]. It is the beginning of Act III of _Die Walküre_. Essentially, it was a large introduction and build up of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Brünnhilde who are preparing to move fallen heroes to Valhalla. This theme is used to represent these sisters throughout the cycle. Outside of the cycle, it has come to represent a ride into battle or war. Most notably, it was used in the film _Apocalypse Now_ [4].

Another leitmotif is that of _Valhalla_ [5]. It signifies the castle built by Wotan, and changes throughout the cycle to stand for Wotan himself and the power and glory of the Gods. It is mostly played by the brass section, and is major keyed. It is powerful and godly, and sounds almost "churchy".

The sword leitmotif is "crucial to the _Ring_ cycle" [6]. It spans three characters and all four operas. It first appears when a sword is stuck a tree that throws through the middle of the house that Hunding lives in. Sieglinde lives there as his wife against her will, and when Siegmund comes in, he falls in love with her. When Sieglinde leaves to do something from Hunding, she looks at the tree and we hear the leitmotif play. Another time it plays is when the lights come up in _Die Walküre_ and something shines from the tree, and again when Siegmund decides to champion Sieglinde by taking the sword from the tree and fighting Hunding.

These three, as well nearly every other leitmotif (including the Ring, the Rhinehold, and others) are modified and adapt throughout the cycle. For example, if there is trouble ahead, the sword leitmotif is moved one half-step down, and it has a minor sound and seems more ominous. Conversely, a higher tone can mean happier times ahead.

The _Ring_ cycle was revolutionary in many different ways. From the specially-built opera house for it to be performed in, to the first real evolutionary use of leitmotifs, it is extraordinary. Today, it is quite the undertaking for any opera company. It is still played at the Bayreuth Festival, where the complete cycle is performed on most cycles. Some productions, like the coproduction between the San Francisco Opera and Washington National Opera, have occurred over many years, adding another part of the cycle every few years. Despite the undertaking, it is still considered one of the most famous operas in the world.
