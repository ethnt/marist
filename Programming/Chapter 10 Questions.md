11. Both computer science and the natural sciences use the scientific method and they both require similar problem solving skills. They differ in that natural sciences are easy to define (biology is the study of life, chemistry is the study of chemicals and their reactions) while computer science is not, and computer science is more concerned with computation, not just computers.
12. Alan Turing created the Turing machine, which proves that not all problems are solvable using algorithms. It is one of the most simplistic computation machines, and the way it works is similar to modern computers.
13. `BEWARE THE IDES OF MARCH` &rarr; `EHZDUH WKH LGHV RI PDUFK`
14. `BRX JRW LW` &rarr; `YOU GOT IT`
15. In public-key encryption, only the recipient's private key is needed to send encrypted messages. The sender uses the recipient's private key to encode the message (recipient sends public key to sender, retains private key; sender uses public key to encrypt message; recipient uses private key to decrypt message).
16. Parallel processing is when several CPUs work together to solve a probelm. In Deep Blue, there are 32 general purpose cores and 512 special-purpose chess cores to play chess in a tournament setting.
17. Multitasking is when an operating system switches between tasks so quickly that it is effictively doing several tasks at the same time. This is all for one user &mdash; timesharing computers do this, but on one computer simultaneously.
18. Since data is broadcast with radio waves with WiFi and 3G, it can be intercepted by anyone within range. This danger can be reduced with end-to-end encryption.
19. Requirement analysis and specification; design; implementation; testing; operation and maintenance (though with certain development strategies like test-driven development, implementation and testing would be switched).
20. I would ask subjective, personal questions, not fact-based questions.
21. Computers are being used to map genomes and chromosomes, as well as create precise mixtures for vaccines and other pharmaceuticals.
22. Down syndrome is caused by mutation C in chromosome 21. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutation P in chromosome 7q.
23. Copying that software would be in violation of section 1.5 of the ACM Code of Ethics.
24. By leaving bugs in important, life-dependent technology, you are violating sections 1.2 and 2.5 of the ACM Code of Ethics. You should thoroughly test the software instead of rushing to complete it.
