You often need many passes at a piece of literature (or any medium, for that matter) to fully understand it. On the first read of a book, you only get the surface-level material. On that second read, you see more and more depth.

Another interpretation would be that everything is a remix of something else — there isn't anything "original". Things become mixed up and rewritten to the point where every time we pick up a piece of "new" material, it is actually an amalgamation of old material.

***

* A literary element is a "how", what that element does or represent is the "what"

#### What
 
* **What**: represents the ideas embedded in the text (things not "seen" by everyone, often not agreed upon).
* Content
* Meaning
* Abstract
* Subjective
* Interpretation

#### How

* **How**: the format elements of the text in question (things that everyone who reads the text can see, and the things that the analyst is assigned to examine closely; "how" the text means and communicates).
* Form
* "Text"
* Concrete
* Objective
* Analysis

### Things to Consider

1. Form and content: this relationship is reciprocal
2. The _argument_ being made: claim, grounds, warrants
3. Interpret: when considering the warrants, how do they reflect deeper ideas about our lives and culture?
4. Form and content: if you are arguing that the grounds and warrants behind the advertisement are suggesting something about our culture, what data/info from the work itself will support that argument
