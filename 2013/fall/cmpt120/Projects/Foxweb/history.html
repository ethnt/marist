				<h2>History of the Internet</h2>

				<h3>Who started the Internet?</h3>
				<p>Defense's Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), led by Larry Roberts, created a small network called ARPANet between the University of California Los Angeles, University of California Santa Barbara, the Stanford Research Institute, and the University of Utah. When the infrastructure was fully implemented, researchers could execute commands on other computers in the networks and share hardware and software costs. Additionally, researchers could share information by transferring text and data files from one location to another. The U.S. Department of Defense had originally intended ARPANet to connect military installations and universities, but it grew in popularity and eventually all universities wanted to be part of the Internet (as it was now being called).</p>

				<h3>What is the main protocol of the Internet?</h3>
				<p>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) control the flow of packets across the Internet. TCP is responsible for the method by which messages are broken down into packets and built up into messages again. IP is concerned with labeling the packets for delivery and controlling the packets' path from sender to recipient.</p>
				<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) allows for IP addresses to be assigned a human-readable (and -rememberable) name. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers are responsible for designating other companies that can sell rights to domain names to consumers.</p>
				<p>Domains are comprised of several parts:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>A sub-domain that refers to a computer within an organization (<code>www</code>).</li>
					<li>A domain that refers to an organization (<code>google</code>).</li>
					<li>A top-level domain that was intended to represent the location or type of organization (<code>com</code>).</li>
				</ol>
				<p>A browser sends out a request to a local DNS to look up the requested domain in its' table. Once found, the DNS sends back the corresponding IP address, and then the browser makes a request to that IP address.</p>

				<h3>Who invented the World Wide Web?</h3>
				<p>Tim Berners-Lee invented a basic web server and a command-line web browser at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN). This was implemented by Marc Andreesen and Eric Bina at the University of Illinois's National Center for Supercomputing Associations (NCSA), when they created the first graphical browser, Mosaic, in 1993. Because of the ease of access to information with Mosaic, Andreesen eventually founded the Netscape Communications Corporation which created Netscape Navigator, the first modern web browser.</p>


				<h3>How can we describe the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web?</h3>
				<p>The Internet is the interconnectedness of the computers and devices. The World Wide Web is the HTTP layer on top of TCP/IP. Therefore, the Internet could exist without the Web, but the Web could not exist without the Internet. The Internet provides the Web with a network to run on.</p>
