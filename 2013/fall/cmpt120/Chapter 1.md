# Chapter 1: Computer Basics

## Hardware

* **hardware**: physical components of a computer
* **von Neumann architecture**: includes three components (input/output devices, memory, and a central processing unit); all modern computers have this architecture as their underlying structure
* **central processing unit (CPU)**: carries out programmatic steps in order to process data
* **memory**: stores information for the CPU to process
* **input/output devices (I/O)**: allows the user to communicate with the computer and then view the results

Measurement    | Value
---------------|-------------------
1 bit          | 2 values (`0` or `1`)
1 byte         | 8 bits
1 kilobyte     | 2^10 bytes = 1024 bytes
1 megabyte     | 2^20 bytes = 1048576 bytes = 1024 kilobytes
1 gigabyte     | 2^30 bytes = 1073741824 bytes = 1024 megabytes
1 terabyte     | 2^40 bytes = 1099511627776 bytes = 1024 gigabytes
1 gigahertz    | 1 billion instructions per second


* **cache memory**: memory that is built into the CPU chip that utilizes high-speed electronic memory to provide extremely fast access to data
* **random access memory (RAM)**: slower, separate memory chips that communicate with the CPU
* **primary memory**: cache and RAM together (*volatile*, which means that it requires a constant flow of electricty to retain stored values)
* **secondary memory**: persistent memory that retains data without power (such as a hard disk or solid-state drive)


## Software

* **software**: programs that execute on the hardware
* **systems software**: manages the resources and behavior of the computer itself
* **operating system**: a collection of programs that controls how the CPU, memory, and I/O devices work together to execute programs
* **kernel**: manages the CPU's operation, controlling how data and instructions are loaded from memory and accessed by the CPU; not actually multitasking, just switching between programs at a very fast rate to create the illusion of simultaneous execution; coordinates other hardware components, allowing software applications to access memory and interact with the input/output devices
* **file system**: manages the computer's memory, organizing storage into files and directories
* **file**: a document that stores information
* **directory**: a collection of files that are organized together and labeled with a common name
* **graphical user interface (GUI)**: uses visual elements to simplify the process of viewing files and executing programs
