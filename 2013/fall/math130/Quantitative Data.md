# Quantitative Data

* **five number summary**: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum
* **order statistic**: the quantities that come immediately from ordering

### Reporting on histograms

* shape (unimodal, bimodal, symmetric, skew)
* spread (range, interquartile range)
* center (median, mean)
* can also visualize five-number summary with box plot
* range (can give a range for the range, because can't give exact minimum and maximum numbers)

### Example

Data set: `{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}`

`n` = 7
