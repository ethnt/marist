# Chapter 2: Understanding the Importance of a Business Plan

#### What a business plan shows:

* What your industry will look like
* What markets you want to compete in
* What competition you'll be up against
* What products and services you want to offer
* What value you can provide customers
* What long-term advantages you think you'll have
* How big and profitable your company can become

## Stakeholders

* **venture capital** and **angels**: companies that raise money and give to new companies in exchange for a stake in the company
* **seed financing**: the money needed to prove that you are a viable business (eg., prototype, betas)
* **start-up financing**: the money needed to bring the company/product to market
* **first-stage financing**: money that comes after start-up financing to support further growth
* **second-stage financing**: money raised after your business has proved itself
* **mezzanine financing**: falls between equity investment and a standard bank loan; allows a company to expand in a particular direction without necessarily having to give up additional ownership in the business
* **bridge financing**: money that helps a company over temporary rough spots (e.g., before you IPO)
