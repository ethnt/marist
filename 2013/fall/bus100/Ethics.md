# Ethics

* an organization is a _person_, but as an entity, cannot be ethical or unethical â€” but the people within the organization can be
* who do we hold responsible?

### What are ethics?

* **_ethos_**: the characteristic spirit or prevalent tone of sentiment of a people or community
* not a matter of right or wrong as it is a process by which an organization evaluates its decisions
* each person possesses a different ethical barometer that stems from his/her experience and background

### Ethical dilemmas

* result from gross misunderstanding with language, behavior of others, and when to choose between own interests and the interests of others
* affects different stakeholders differently
* situations in which a decision is based largely on judgments and determinations rather than on indisputable facts

### Factors influencing ethics

1. The individual ethics of organizational members
2. The corporate culture of the organization
3. Society as a whole

### Individual ethics

* ethical behavior has a direct impact on goals and actions
* honesty is strongly related to judgements made in the workplace
* values reflected in a person's behavior and personality can be the basis for _professional_ behavior

### Three stages of moral development

1. Preconventional level (obedience and punishment, instrumental purpose and exchange)*
2. Conventional level (interpersonal accord, conformity, social accord, system maintenance)
3. Postconventional level (social contract, universal ethical principles); how we act when there are no clear cut rules

### Organizational ethics

* organization's culture and practice
* impact values, attitudes, and behaviors of its members
* members conform to the standards the organization deems acceptable
* processes must reflect an ethical philosophy that filters through all levels of the organization
* individuals must be shown that they can influence change and make a difference in organizational culture

### Ethical decision-making

* decisions for which there are no apparent, clear-cut rules

### How organizations handle ethics

* code of ethics written by the organization
* ethical audit
* ethics tests (common sense, one's best self, "light of day" approach, purified idea)
* decision-making model
* ethics training
