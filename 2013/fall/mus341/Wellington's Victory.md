_In what way did Beethoven use the instruments to create the effect of victory in "Wellington's Victory"?_

In Ludwig van Beethoven's _Wellington's Victory, or, the Battle of Vitoria_, Op. 91, there is an unusual assortment of instruments. It calls for two flutes, a piccolo, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, a contrabassoon, four horns, six trumpets, three trombones, timpani, a large percussion section (with muskets and other sound effects), and a string section of violins I and II, violas, cellos, and double basses.

The piece is meant to represent the two sides (the British versus the French). It is meant to be very loud, and be representative of the victory of the British. The melody is played by nearly every section of the orchestra simultaneously to create the effect of grandness. This, with the addition of the major key creates a feeling of jubilation and celebration.

The emphasis throughout the entire piece is on the British â€” therefore, _God Save the Queen_ is strengthened by the timpani, trumpets, and artillery.
