# The Art of Song

## German Art Song

* music written to a poem to accompany and add to the drama and emotion of a text
* poems selected from established poets such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich Heine, and Wilhelm Muller (similar to Byron and Keats)

### The Leid

* up until the Leid, solo singers had only been heard in opera
* three forms:
  * **strophic**: each verse/stanza uses the same music
  * **through composed**: where there is no repetition of music (stream of consciousness)
  * **modified strophic**: same as strophic; only one verse is different musically
* _see "Franz Schubert"_4
